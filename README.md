# CTF_ANTS

Our groupâ€™s CTF challenge will be in four stages. The progressive stage is dependent on the challenge solved in the earlier stage. For example, the result of solved stage 1 will be essential for progressing to stage 2. To begin, please open the CTF_ANT.html file with the browser of your choice (eg. chrome, internet explorer) and carefully examine its contents, you may need a pen and paper to write down notes and calculate along the way. Pay close attention to the details and hidden hints within the challenge. Additionally, you will also need to open up the WRITINGSONTHEWALL text file in order to navigate through stage 1 sucessfully. All the best and may your team capture the flag!
