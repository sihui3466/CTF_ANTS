# CTF_ANTS

Our groupâ€™s CTF challenge will be in four stages. 

The progressive stage is dependent on the challenge solved in the earlier stage. 

For example, the result of solved stage 1 will be essential for progressing to stage 2. 

To begin, please open the CTF_ANT.html file with the browser of your choice (eg. chrome, internet explorer)
